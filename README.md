Hello. This is a simple chess web application I created for practice.

* Users can save games, which they can view and replay in their profile's page.
* Users can read the latest chess-related news on the news page.
* Users can read, create, delete, and like blogs on the blog page. They can also add their saved games to blogposts for others to view.
